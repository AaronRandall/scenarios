add js test helper methods, e.g. run with timeout, log (at different levels), step delay (throttling)
customise app to have text input
rename app project
remove unused runner options
detact iOS sdk version for hardware device (see hardware.rb, def build_app)


Changes after discussion with Jcog:
* keep JS tests top-level (with test fn names), and move details into functions in step_definition files.
* check that test devices implement required methods before using
