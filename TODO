Changes after discussion with Jcog:
* keep JS tests top-level (with test fn names), and move details into functions in step_definition files.
* remove test_device.rb from git
* remove base_device.rb
* create project.rb class, which implements:
   clean_build_directory
   create_test_support_files
   build_app
* update device classes to no longer inherit from base_device.
* update device classes to only implement:
   clean_target
   install_app
   run_tests
* update run_test_steps method to take 'project' & 'test_device' objects.
* update run_test_steps to do:
  project.create_test_support_files
  project.clean_build_directory
  project.build_app
  test_device.clean_install_directory (or just 'clean'?)
  test_device.run_tests
