add js test helper methods, e.g. run with timeout, log (at different levels), step delay (throttling)
remove unused runner options

Changes after discussion with Jcog:
* keep JS tests top-level (with test fn names), and move details into functions in step_definition files.
* check that test devices implement required methods before using
